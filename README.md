## Instructions

# First part.

Create a basic registration form.

The user should enter a name, email, phone, password and submit the form.

When the user clicks on the submit button the data should be displayed in a div under the form.

# Second part.

Now let us make this better.

Create an InputElement component, and pass all data to it as props, and an `onChange` event that updates the state in the parent.

Once the user click on submit. The state which is an object should be displayed in a div.

Note: pass the onChange as a prop.
